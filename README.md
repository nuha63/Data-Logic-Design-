# Data Logic Design Lab Problems

This repository contains solutions to lab problems from the **Data Logic Design** course. The implementations use digital circuit design tools and simulators to visualize and verify logical circuits and digital systems.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- **Proteus Professional**  
  Used for simulating digital logic circuits with realistic hardware components like LEDs, switches, and 7-segment displays.  
  *(Common version used: Proteus 8 Professional)*

- **Logisim**  
  A simple, open-source tool used to design and simulate digital logic circuits. Especially helpful for combinational and sequential circuit simulations.

- **Simulator**  
  Refers to any custom or additional simulation software used to verify circuit behavior. This may include online logic simulators or built-in simulation tools from digital logic kits.
